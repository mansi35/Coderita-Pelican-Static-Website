Summary: What wisdom could a wizard of programming impart?

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="../images/wizard1.jpeg"></div>

Programs must be written for **__people to read__**, and only incidentally for **__machines to execute__**.

<div style="text-align: right">– Hal Abelson, SICP</div>

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. **__Good programmers__** write code that **__humans__** can understand.

<div style="text-align: right">– Kent Beck</div>

It is not knowledge, but the **__act of learning__**, not possession but the **__act of getting there__** which generates the greatest satisfaction.

<div style="text-align: right">- C.F. Gauss</div>

It is The ultimate test of whether I understand something is if I can explain it to a computer. I can say something to you and you’ll nod your head, but I’m not sure that I explained it well. But the computer doesn’t nod its head. It repeats back exactly what I tell it. In most of life, you can bluff, but not with computers.

<div style="text-align: right">- Donald Knuth</div>

Write clear code, not clever code.

<div style="text-align: right">- Asokan Pichai</div>

##Guideline Revised##
Minimise time needed by someone else to understand a piece of your code.

Remember that someone else may be you, six months after writing the code.
