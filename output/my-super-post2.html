                <h2><div style="text align:center">Objecting to Objects: Summary</div></h2>
<div style="text align:right">By Stephen C. Johnson, Melismatic Software</div>

<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is currently being hyped as the best way to do literally everything. Not only that, it’s claimed benefits are often untrue and on top of that it is expensive. And all this hype for OOP is preventing progress in tackling problems that are both more important and harder because it is simply not versatile.  Control of parallel and distributed applications, GUI design and implementation, fault tolerant and real-time programming; OOP has little to offer these areas.</p>
<p>Key notions such as encapsulation and reuse have been discussed as far back as the 60's, and received a lot of discussion and finally in the late 1980’s the really organized OOP hype started. Gradually everyone started participating in these hype wars.</p>
<p>In the early 1990’s, the field of software development has a very poor state and hence it played a major role in fueling this hype. Since people were reluctant to buy cheap 1970’s software instead of the expensive software at that time, the specialists believed that maybe if objects were introduced this situation could be fixed.</p>
<p>The author believes that the people are interested in tools, including languages, that make it easier and more productive to generate large serious high quality software products and OOP is not the solution to every problem.</p>
<p>Then the question arises that if most OOP ideas were alive and well 20 to 25 years ago, why didn't they solve the software problem then? Well, the programming languages are not like the laws in physics or the mathematical theorems. Programming languages exist to organize and tame cycles. In 1967, it was a very different world. Every computer component was very costly.</p>
<p>It is a much more defensible position to argue that we are just inherently slow at adopting new ways of thinking, no matter what field. This suggests that the latest techniques, be they OOP or otherwise, are a step in the slow process of our learning to think in MIPS rather than IPS, and even if there were no further advance in hardware we could still be decades in digesting the hardware we already have.</p>
<p>But it is not really like that OOP is just a big waste. It has many benefits too focusing on designing the software models, including the roles and interactions of the modules, enabling the modules to encapsulate expertise, and carefully designing the interfaces between these modules. But it is not like that OOP is the only one giving these benefits; most of the older programming systems allow these techniques as well. And the use of objects and inheritance is not what makes these programs good.</p>
<p>The thing that really matters is the design and structure of the program based on clear and well communicating principles. What makes a piece of software good has a lot to do with the application of thought to the problem being addressed, and not much to do with what language or methodology you used.</p>
<p>Well, OOP claims that it allows code to be developed faster but never specified, faster than what? It has kept people in a blindfold.</p>
<p>OOP is also misleading people when it claims of code reuse. The exact definition of code reusability is, your code needs to do something that I want done, and your code needs to operate within the same model of the program and environment as my code. Well OOP doesn’t solve that second problem.</p>
<p>One of the major long-term advantages of object-oriented techniques may be that it can support broad algorithmic reuse, of a style similar to the Standard Template Library (STL) of C++. But the in STL several of the early generations were coded in Ada and SCHEME hence proving that it’s power is not in the language, but in the ideas.</p>
<p>One other advantage claimed by OOP is higher quality code. But again code quality doesn’t depend on method of implementation but effective implementation, intelligent design and rigorous testing. And OOP does not address these problems effectively.</p>
<p>Since header files used in OOP are themselves bigger in size, they also tend to grow proportionally as we write a larger code. And instead of optimizing your code, this poses a lot of problems, since header files tend to be included in lots of other files.</p>
<p>But since many companies are leaning towards OOP with the aim of bringing their development costs for large programs under control, disappointment is inevitable.</p>
<p>While making simple user interfaces we still struggle hard coordinating and relating objects to each other. While many user interfaces are influenced by OOP ideas, it is still difficult to control widgets having dozens of attributes.</p>
<p>Inheritance may be considered a solution for this. But none of these techniques come close to matching GUI builders. It will be hard for any language to beat that. OOP based languages also do not support threads, limiting its usefulness in GUI area.</p>
<p>Relating two or more objects is the most common programming problem. These simple relations are the toughest to code. Linguistic support of these object relations would need to consider relations as first-class citizens, capable of being created, destroyed, and potentially stored on files. There are some great language issues here, and potentially a huge payoff.</p>
<p>Objects are ephemeral. If you want to save an object, you must write it out, one byte at a time, onto a conventional file system, and then hope that somebody else who understands what bytes you wrote and why can put it together again when you need to read the object. This type of code is hard to write, change and almost impossible to debug.  Persistent object systems are supposed to fix all this and C++ has some serious issues involved in supporting persistent objects. Moreover, a single object is rarely what you want--you often have a collection of objects bound together into lists, sets, and graphs and the same object may be involved with several such structures. Even some very simple cases (such as an object being on two different lists, both of which need to be saved) severely challenge the current mechanisms.</p>
<p>So, at last we can conclude that, much of what is "known" about a language is something that was true, or at widely believed, at one point in the language's history, but may not be true currently. As professionals, it is our responsibility to ask whether moving to OOP is in the best interests of us. We must also reject the fad when it will not meet our needs. So we can say that some projects are meant to be done with OOP and some may be not but what really matters is the final product.</p>
<p>At last we can say that the only way to construct good software is to think about it. Since the scope of problems that software attempts to address is so vast, the kinds of solutions that that we need is also vast. And any one particular technology is not the solution for every problem.</p>
